# HOW TO USE IT.
To use the CSM do the typical client side mod installing process for Luanti. 
Then enable the CSM and in a game you can type any of the following: ```.wp_add``` to add a waypoint with with the name and a optional hex color following it (```.wp_add waypoint-name ff00ff``` makes a waypoint with the server name 
and the distance of nodes you are from it), to remove one simply type ```.wp_del``` and then the name after it (```.wp_del waypoint-name``` very straight forward), and if you want to edit the color of a waypoint for any reason you can do
```.wp_edit``` with the name after it (```.wp_edit waypoint-name ff0f0f``` also very straight forward)
